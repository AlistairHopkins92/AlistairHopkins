                            <p>Trace is a CMS built for Homeserve, the utility services company. It is used to manage home visits for boiler repairs, surveys, installations, safety checks and other visits. Originally Roco's work on Trace was a routing component as a standalone app (v3), to be embedded in a pre-existing CMS built by another 3rd party company. This won us the contract to replace the existing CMS with an integrated solution (v4).</p>
